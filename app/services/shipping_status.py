# app/services/shipping_status.py
"""
Single source of truth for mapping Shiprocket's courier statuses onto our
``OrderStatus`` enum, and for building payloads in Shiprocket's real wire
format.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The mapping used to be written twice: once in the real webhook handler and once
in the admin "simulator" endpoint. The two copies had already drifted — the
simulator knew about NOC/exception states the webhook did not, and the webhook
mis-mapped the real Shiprocket status ``RTO IN TRANSIT`` to SHIPPED because it
substring-matched "IN TRANSIT" before checking RTO. Both sides now call
:func:`map_shiprocket_status`, so they cannot drift again.

The simulator builds payloads with :func:`build_tracking_webhook_payload`, which
emits the same ``{"data": {...}}`` envelope Shiprocket POSTs to a tracking
webhook. Going live is therefore a config change, not a code change: set
``SHIPPING_PROVIDER=shiprocket`` and point Shiprocket's panel at
``/api/v1/webhooks/shiprocket``.

Status vocabulary and codes
---------------------------
The *status strings* are taken from Shiprocket's own public pages — their order
tracker (shiprocket.in/blog/shipment-tracking) and their RTO terminology guide
(shiprocket.in/blog/return-to-origin-processing-terminology). Both are quoted in
``tests/test_shiprocket_shipping.py::test_14`` so a regression here is caught.

The *numeric* ``shipment_status`` table below is best-effort: Shiprocket's API
reference is a Postman Documenter app with no public OpenAPI spec, so the code
numbers could not be confirmed against an official source. That is safe by
construction — :func:`map_shiprocket_status` matches the human ``current_status`
string first and only falls back to a number, so a wrong code degrades to a
recorded scan rather than a wrong order transition. Verify the numbers against
one real payload from your Shiprocket account's webhook tester when going live.

# `order.status` (pending/processing/shipped/...) is the *order* lifecycle, and
# `shipment_status` is the *courier's* raw vocabulary. The admin UI used to
# render `shipment_status` directly, so an order showed a bare "PICKUP_SCHEDULED"
# / "IN TRANSIT" / "NOC" pill with no indication of what it means or what to do
# next — and the status colours were hand-maintained in several JSX files that
# had already drifted apart.
#
# This collapses a shipment onto a small set of *stages* the UI can render
# consistently. The stages match what an operations person actually acts on, and
# mirror the milestones Shiprocket emails customers about (packed, picked,
# shipped, out for delivery, delivered).
#
# ``step`` is the position on the happy-path track (1-5) so the admin can draw a
# progress bar; ``None`` means the parcel is off the happy path (returned,
# cancelled, or stalled on an exception) and must not be drawn as progress.
