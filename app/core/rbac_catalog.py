# app/core/rbac_catalog.py
"""Single source of truth for the RBAC permission catalog and system roles.

- ``PERMISSIONS``: every permission key the codebase understands. New keys are
  added here (by developers) + a migration seeds them. The admin dashboard
  never invents keys — it only ticks checkboxes from this list.
- ``SYSTEM_ROLES``: slug -> permission keys granted to the 4 legacy roles.
  Mirrors the old ``require_role(...)`` hierarchy so the migration is
  behavior-preserving.
